# Podcasts

This project contains an Android application which uses the [Listen Notes API](https://www.listennotes.com/api/ "Listen Api Homepage") to get metadata about podcasts then plays it through Android Auto. It was created for the thesis at the end of my BSc degree.

## Abstract
Nowadays, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay is getting readily available inside cars for the end users, which allows them to be so-called “connected” to the world while driving by reading their messages, emails or playing a selected media instead of the default radio through the speakers of the car. The technology is of immense importance because if the user does the activity not on a controlled interface but on their phone, they endanger not only themselves but other road users as well. Thus, the person who likes to listen to podcasts should be allowed to do so through the infotainment system of the car and not through fumbling on their phone.

In my thesis I planned to implement an application suitable for solving the previously mentioned problem, the use of which is intuitive and also satisfies any other user needs that may arise. Although the language of the application is English, the podcasts are available in a wide range of languages. Not to mention that there are little to no subjects regarding with one can’t find a podcast which talks about it. The task proved to be useful, since during its implementation I was able to get a deeper knowledge and gain valuable experience in connection with the Android platform and software development for it.

The thesis clarifies the set task, describes the technologies used for its implementation, gives a detailed description of the finished application, presents the method of testing the application and provides a user description.
